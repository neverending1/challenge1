# Challenge 1

## Description

This project was to demonstrate that I can modify a codebase to meet accessibility standards so that the site is optimised for search engines. Accessible design is vital as it improves access to information on the web for any individual thus leading to more usage. To meet this criteria my code included HTML with semantic elements which follow a logical structure, accessible alt attributes which fall in sequential order and a concise descriptive title.
